Duck Hunt!

Duck Hunt is copyright Nintendo, 1984
This is a fan remake and all that jazz.

If Nintendo gets upset, replace "Duck Hunt" with
"AMAZING LIGHTGUN MINI-VIDEO-GAME EXTRAVAGANZA" :)

I've never done anything with electronics before,
so apologies for my code, which is probably not that
great. I'm a n00b. Especially with bit-shifting and
manipulating registers. I like high-level things like
Python most of the time. Bits are scary.
